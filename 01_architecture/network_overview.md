# Network Overview

This project represents a secure campus-style network built in Cisco Packet Tracer.

The network is segmented using VLANs to separate departments and enforce security boundaries.
Inter-VLAN routing is implemented using a router-on-a-stick approach.

Core components:
- One core router (R-CORE)
- One core switch (S-CORE)
- Multiple access switches
- Central server providing DHCP, DNS, and Web services

The design focuses on:
- Network segmentation
- Centralized services
- Access control using ACLs
- Basic enterprise security principles
